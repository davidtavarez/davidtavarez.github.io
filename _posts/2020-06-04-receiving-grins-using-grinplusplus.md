To recive \$GRIN ツ cannot be more easier... you just need to [make sure your wallet is reachable](https://davidtavarez.github.io/2020/bypass-internet-censorship-and-filtering-grinplusplus/) and provide the generated address to the sender. Some users ask themselves which address should they give? The simple answer is: you can use either one.

The first address: **54quafp5ug6z2akgflkynlaxwtdjhzytxrhk5q3gxptbaowvwliv32qd** is used for sending via Tor. The second one: **http://54quafp5ug6z2akgflkynlaxwtdjhzytxrhk5q3gxptbaowvwliv32qd.grinplusplus.com/** can be used to receive coins if the sender does not support Tor. In both cases you don't need to worry about port forwarding.

Since my wallet is green I can receive my coins...

After a few the transaction will be fully confirmed and I will be able to spend those coins.
