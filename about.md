I'm **David Tavarez**, but I prefer people to call me just "**David**". I've been coding since I was 12 years old and people usually think that I am a geek or something but I'm not, it's just I like to learn (as much as I can) how things are done and how much I can improve them.ager. Looking forward to exchange snooping-free messages with you.

Regards.
